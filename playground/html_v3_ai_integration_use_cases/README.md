# HTML v3 AI Integration Use Cases

## 🚀 Transforming Conversations into Actionable Workflows

This directory contains real-world demonstrations of how the HTML v3 Form Chain Engine can be augmented with AI/LLM capabilities to convert unstructured natural language conversations into structured, actionable multi-step workflows.

## 🌟 Core Concept

The key insight comes from a simple WhatsApp conversation:
```
Mom: Cabbage, tomato paste, celery, red & green bell pepper
Mom: Anything else you want in the soup
Mom: Yogurt & milk please
```

This unstructured conversation contains valuable structured data that can be transformed into actionable workflows using AI.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **LLMProvider Abstract Class** (`html_v3_ai.py`)
   - Interface for different AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
   - Conversation analysis methods
   - Form schema generation
   - Response processing

2. **ConversationFormBridge** (`html_v3_ai.py`)
   - Bridges conversational AI with form chains
   - Maintains conversation context
   - Triggers form generation at appropriate times

3. **AIFormChainGenerator** (`html_v3_ai.py`)
   - Creates dynamic form chains from conversations
   - Generates Pydantic models on the fly
   - Manages multi-step workflows

## 🔧 Integration Pattern

```python
# 1. Process conversation
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I need help with..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Additional context..."}
]

# 2. AI analyzes and extracts entities
analysis = await ai_provider.analyze_conversation(context)

# 3. Generate dynamic form schema
schema = await ai_provider.generate_form_schema(context)

# 4. Create form chain with Pydantic models
chain = await generator.create_form_chain_from_conversation(
    messages, chain_id, title
)

# 5. Execute workflow
result = await chain.process_step(step_id, user_data)
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pydantic asyncio
```

### Running Examples

1. **Shopping Assistant Demo**
```bash
python shopping_assistant.py
```

2. **Medical Intake Demo**
```bash
python medical_intake_ai.py
```

3. **All Demos**
```bash
python run_all_demos.py
```

## 💡 Key Benefits

1. **Natural User Experience**: Users communicate naturally; AI handles structure
2. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Forms adapt based on conversation context
3. **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic categorization and priority assignment
4. **Knowledge Integration**: Leverages domain-specific knowledge bases
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new use cases and providers
