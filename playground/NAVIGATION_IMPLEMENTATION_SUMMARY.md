## Technical Implementation

### Session Management
```python
active_sessions[session_id] = {
    "chain": onboarding_chain,
    "state": {},  # Stores all step data
    "current_step": "basic_info",
    "started_at": datetime.now()
}
```

### State Persistence
- State encoded in base64 and passed with forms
- Server maintains session state
- Navigation preserves all entered data

### Conditional Routing
- IT Equipment step only shown for Engineering department
- Navigation adapts based on conditional logic
