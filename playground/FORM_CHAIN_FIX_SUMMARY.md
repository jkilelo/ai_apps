# Form Chain v3 - Fix Summary

## Issue
When submitting step 3 of the data quality chain, the server returned a 500 Internal Server Error with the message "Form submission failed".

## Root Cause
The issue was in the form chain's data flow between steps:

1. **Step 3's `QualityActionRequest` model** requires two fields from the previous step:
   - `table_name` (string)
   - `quality_score` (float)

2. **Step 2's `QualityCheckResponse` model** originally only contained:
   - `columns_checked`
   - `quality_issues`
   - `quality_score`
   - `recommendations`

3. The `table_name` was missing from Step 2's response, causing validation errors when Step 3 tried to pre-populate its form.

## Solution

### 1. Updated `QualityCheckResponse` model to include `table_name`:
```python
class QualityCheckResponse(BaseModel):
    table_name: str  # Added to pass to next step
    columns_checked: List[str]
    quality_issues: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    quality_score: float
    recommendations: List[str]
```

### 2. Updated `QualityCheckProcessor` to populate `table_name` from chain state:
```python
# Get table name from chain state
table_name = chain_context.get("step_step_1_response", {}).get("table_name", "unknown")

return QualityCheckResponse(
    table_name=table_name,  # Now included in response
    columns_checked=input_data.columns_to_check,
    quality_issues=issues,
    quality_score=round(quality_score, 2),
    recommendations=recommendations
)
```

## How the Form Chain Works

1. **Step 1** collects database connection info and table name
2. **Step 2** performs quality checks and now passes both `table_name` and `quality_score` forward
3. **Step 3** receives these values and pre-populates its form fields automatically

## Key Insight
In the Form Chain v3 paradigm, each step's **response model** must include all fields that the next step's **request model** requires. This enables the automatic data flow between steps without manual field mapping.

## Testing
After the fix, the form chain works correctly:
- Step 2 response includes `table_name`
- Step 3 form is pre-populated with both `table_name` and `quality_score`
- No validation errors occur
- Form submission succeeds

## Important Note
**Always restart the FastAPI server after making code changes!**
```bash
# Kill existing server
pkill -f "python html_v3_demo_server.py"

# Start new server
python html_v3_demo_server.py
```
